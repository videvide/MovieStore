# movie-store

.NET Project made by Sebastian(https://github.com/Sebbev) and myself during our time at Lexicon East, Aug 2020. 

It's an API-based 'movie-lookup' service which has some webshop similarities. Users searches for movies and the app fetches data from the OMDB-API. The user could then 'purchase' a movie. 

We called it movie-store just because that was the name of our assignment. 

Fun times!!
